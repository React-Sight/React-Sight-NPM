React Sight is a live view of the component hierarchy tree of your React application with support for React Router and Redux.

## Set Up

1. Run npm install for Right Sight in your root project folder

```
npm install --save-dev react-sight
```

```

import React, { Component } from 'react';
// Add import statement

//Wrap <Sight> Component around your application
ReactDOM.render(
  <Sight>
    </App>
  </Sight>
  document.getElementById('root'),
);
```

or

```
//Wrap <Sight> Component around your application
ReactDOM.render(
  <Sight>
    <Provider store={store}>
      <BrowserRouter>
        <Switch>
          <Route exact path="/" component={App} />
          <Route exact path="/chat" component={Chat} />
